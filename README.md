# Daniel_AI SafeCore

## Overview
Daniel_AI SafeCore is a centralized, modular, and auditable security kernel designed to provide a robust security foundation for enterprise applications. It integrates advanced security mandates including sidecar/mTLS architectures, forensic-grade auditing, and AI-driven threat purification.

## Core Modules
1.  **IAM & Zero Trust**: Identity Access Management with strict Zero Trust principles.
2.  **Encryption & Key Management**: Centralized management of cryptographic keys and encryption standards.
3.  **Immutable Auditor**: A permanent, tamper-evident logging system.
4.  **AI Purifier**: AI-based input/output sanitization and threat detection.
5.  **Layer Orchestrator**: Manages inter-module communication and policy enforcement.
